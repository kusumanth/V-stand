Our project is about building a platform for the Blue collared workers to give great exposure to the work opportunities present around them. And also for the people who require repair works and other household works cannot find reliable, trustworthy, and efficient workers who can solve their issues. So there would be web applications where the people who require workers could select the type of work according to their requirements. And then the blue-collared workers who are near the locality of the customer would get an IVR call about quoting the amount he would charge for the work and then it would be reflected on the screen of the customer and after confirmation, a text message would be sent to the blue collared worker about the details of the work and location of work.
